RNIR was initiated as a series of tutorials on [chemometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemometrics) and near-infrared (NIR) spectral analysis with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). R and RStudio are both free and open source.

All the data used in the tutorials can be downloaded from RNIR's [GitHub](https://github.com/guifh/RNIR) repository. This ensures that any given example can be easily reproduced.

RNIR presents the most common methods employed in NIR spectroscopy for processing spectra and was written in [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html).

**Unfortunatly, since 2018, RNIR is not longer maintained. Note also that the License has been updated.**
