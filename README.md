# Welcome to RNIR!

RNIR was initiated as a series of tutorials on chemometrics and near-infrared (NIR) spectral analysis with R and RStudio. R and RStudio are both free and open source.

All the data used in the tutorials can be downloaded from this GitHub repository. This ensures that any given example can be easily reproduced.

RNIR presents the most common methods employed in NIR spectroscopy for processing spectra and was written in Rmarkdown.

**Unfortunatly, since 2018, RNIR is not longer maintained. Note also that the License has been updated.**
